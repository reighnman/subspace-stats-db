/*
Refreshes the stats of players for a specified team versus stat period from game data.
Through normal operation, the save_game function will automatically record to the player_versus_stats table.
This function can be used to manually refresh the data if needed.
For example, if you were to add a stat period for a period_range that includes past games.
Or, if for some reason you suspect player_versus_stat data is out of sync with game data.

Use this with caution, as it can result in a long running operation.
For example, if you specify a 'forever' period it will need to read every game record 
matching the stat period's game type, which will likely be very large # of records to process.

Parameters:
p_stat_period_id - Id of the stat period to refresh player stat data for.

Usage:
select ss.refresh_player_versus_stats(18);

select * from ss.game_mode;
select * from ss.stat_period;
select * from ss.stat_period_type;
select * from ss.stat_tracking;
select * from ss.player_rating;
