/*
Gets the top players by average rating for a specified stat period.

Parameters:
p_stat_period_id - Id of the stat period to get data for.
p_top - The rank limit results. 
	E.g. specify 5 to get players with rank [1 - 5].
	This is not the limit of the # of players to return.
	If multiple players share the same rank, they will all be returned.
p_min_games_played - The minimum # of games a player must have played to be included in the result.

Usage:
select * from ss.get_top_versus_players_by_avg_rating(17, 5, 3);
select * from ss.get_top_versus_players_by_avg_rating(17, 5);
